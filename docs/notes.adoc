== About this document
This document contains the transcription of my personal journal when designing and
building link:https://github.com/the01/python-paps[paps] and writing my bachelor thesis.
While this journal entries do give you a good overview of the project's history,
they are not blog posts. They sometimes just follow my train of thought when working
on and trying to solve a problem. Which is why they, at times, are not written in
complete sentences. I have included them here anyway, because they demonstrate what
kind of difficulties I encountered, how I solved them and what kind of considerations
went into particular design decisions.

  Voltage Divider measure V

- IR/Sonic Sensor
- Capacitive Sensor

Sound < 10ms latency not noticeable +
11-20ms monitoring starts unusable, smearing +
20-30 ms delayed sounds --> actual delay

200 bpm - 5ms

not much about accurate timing, when to start/stop, but more a holding (several
times the start precision) and not ending either.

*Reaction Time Tests:* Takes some time from the point when the human audience
member gets the signal to move to the time he actually moves to the time the
system registers the actual point in time where the senor recognizes activity.
The latency between signal to human-initiates movement might be cut shorter,
e.g. with periodic activities ("im Takt") or with a little head start.

The stand up/sit down method of interaction with the system probably is not
suitable for longer sessions since it is quite a tiring exercise. If several
up/downs are required the participation will significantly go down.
Additionally as the people get more tired, their reaction time/time span between
starting the movement and the triggering of the sensor increases.
As such the system becomes more inconsistent/imprecise over time. It could
maybe be used as a sort of training method. +
This kind of interface automatically excludes people from participation.
Old people or people with disabilities will have major problems with this
kind of sensor. It follows that at first a survey/plan is necessary, which
user base we will want to cover. +
Sensors in the arm rest are a good option. A button press is a lot less strenuous
and opens the system up for different kinds of interactions per human. The
is-occupied-sensor might still be deployed, but maybe only used as a rare/special
type of event. This doesn't solve the second problem, but it does the first. +
A possible improvement of the simple up/down design would be to incorporate several
sensors in one chair. Dependent on the precision and resolution of those
sensors (pressure plates) this setup could enable a control via shifting your
eating position, e.g. lean forward/backward or left/right. With that lean people
with problematic legs could use the system. Additionally this design opens up more
control options. +
However there are two big problems with this idea. Primarily it is questionable
whether the left-right/forward-backward movement is detectable. And even if it
were possible, such sensors are most likely rather expensive or at least more
expensive than a simple one that only needs to register seat occupancy. On a
greater scale the simpler solution will probably prove to be more economical.
The occupancy-sensor is easier to deploy in different kinds of
chairs/cushions/upholstery setups.

If the system is intended to be used in much the same way as the McFarlin video
of harmonics, it won't be as impressive since every button will result in the
perfect tone to be emitted. It is not a sum of all sub-tones, but at best the
volume is dependent on the sum of single inputs.

- ZeroConf (Bonjour) +
-> easier to set up; +
might need to change because of high traffic in network
- Mutlicast for discovery (239.255.0.0-239.255.255.255: multicast group) +
  mac -> bind to 0.0.0.0 +
  win -> bind to specific local ip

Multicast as way to register clients/servers +
announce server every 30 secs? +
do clients register to the server - clients -> server +
server registers to the clients - server -> clients

clients -> server: server needs to regularly send (30sec) msg; +
*lots* of packets; only needed in initial stage +
since clients need to listen anyway -> *clients -> server*

[NOTE]
Is it possible that the multicast listen socket is the same as the "normal"
listening socket???

client goes online -> send JOIN-Packet via multicast (send id, ip, maybe more
infos of the client in the JOIN-Packet)

Server implements CONFIG-Packet to transmit changes in the configuration. +
Is sent to a newly registered client (upon JOIN-Packet) or to the multicast-group
(upon config changes at runtime)

client sends STATUS-Packet directly to server if an action occurs on the pi to
inform the server of the state change.

ID ≈ TCP Sequence Number

In original protocol proposal the timestamp in the ACK-Packet was supposed to be
the same as the one in the original packet. Put the current timestamp when sending
the ACK-Packet and include the original stamp in the payload.

What about the Seq in the ACK? Does it need its own sequence number? Probably not,
since the seq is required for the acknowledge and that only applies to normal packets.
ACKs do not need retransmitting, the original packet just gets sent again and so
does the ensuing ACK. +
Move the ID into the payload. Maybe include an id in the header instead.

Unique id on client from config file. Sends this as proposal to server. Server
might confirm or change this in the ACK or separate packet.

APP might include method to merge packets together so you only need to use one
`send()` instead of two. +
Common fields: Version, TimeStamp +
need two payloads, lengths, MsgTypes, SeqNum, possibly flags

H0: Version/MsgTyp/PayloadLength +
H1: TimeStamp +
no more Id/SeqNum in general header +
H2: Flags +
H3: Reserved

*FLAGS* +
LVB (Least Value Bit)..0 +
HVB....................32

  0..Continue/Continuous Flag: If present `recv()` should read another packet
  after this one (inifinit? - UDP max pack size)

  1..Multipart Flag: If present next packet (according to Seq) contains data
  -> instead payload = payload_packet1 + payload_packet2 +
  can be used if payload exceeds the max. size for UDP-packet size

Protocol not secure against tampering. If someone gets onto the network he can
end packets. +
For example packets with a forged header (the payload length set to high value
- max number) can block a client/server from receiving valid packets. +
Possible solution: Message authentication code

Is the IP unique enough to identify the sender? Lets include it for now?

H2: _p59-ID-Flags header part_ +
ID: 65535 possible participants +
H1: `datetime.now().timetuple()` -> `time.mktime(x)` -> `ts` +
`time.time()` -> `ts` +
`ts` -> `datetime.utcfromtimestamp()`

_p59-Basic APP-Header_

==== JOIN-PACKET (1)
_p60-SeqNum_

- listen IP? -> can be obtained by `recv()`
- listen Port -> can be obtained by `recv()`
- seats
  * seatCount
  * seatNumber, seatNumber,.. (seatCount times)

separate by char '\n' -> `split('\n')` or jsonify +
listenIP/listenPort are received

+04 008 0012 00016 0000020+ +
+16 256 4096 65536 1048576+

Payload = ["s1", "s2", "s3"] -> json

==== ACK-Packet (0)
_p61-SeqNum_

- Seq of original packet
- timestamp of orig packet

-> via header flag _isAck_ +
=> every packet is possible

timestamp optional? only really needed when measuring round trips..maybe
timeouts adjustable +
-> option when rest of the system stable and fast enough +
-> include it as a way of statistics +
-> diagnostic tool - test only one client at a time +
-> set with FLAG (4 byte less)

No continuous flag or the server would need to hold a buffer for each connected
client.

But some state info for each connected client is necessary. Append to that struct
the incomplete packs (with timeout?) and only keep one partial at a time
-> buffer overflow if many forged packets.

how secure does it have to be against tampering? Can foreign devices be present
on the network?

Flag: +
0. Bit: Is Ack Seq. present +
1. Bit: Rev TimeStamp

_p62-JOIN network_

DeviceId really in header? Yes, because IP more likely to change than ID. +
Collision handling: First come, first serve. The one that registers an ID first
can keep it. But what if the IP changes? Include MAC in JOIN?

Problem: Device was once registered, but did not save settings. Upon restart it
should load info from server. How does it know, it was the same? +
Simple: Conflicts by hand. Device id of 0 ≈ request to be assigned a device id;
device id of 1 corresponds to the server

seat nr of 0 means you need to assign one. setup values

client id on server is "<ip>:<port>"

Add every packet sent to an resend `[]` sorted by resend time. If ack for that
packet comes in -> remove it or add the acked packets sequence number to another
list and if a packet comes around to being retransmitted, check first whether the
sequence number of the packet is in the acked seq num list and if, remove them
from both lists. Otherwise retransmit the package and readd it to the resend list,
but only if the max resend count is not overstepped.

Client send seat changes (only the changed state in the particular seat). +
Question is: Wait longer for another seat to change or send multiple packages?
Comes down to reaction time of set change (occupancy sensor) vs network/server usage.

Server has to have strong CPU and (multiple) fast network cards. Can't distribute
the work over several machines, since that would add additional lag by
communication to these sub-servers. Would in theory only work with a load balancer
distributing the client packets by category. Lookup table sorted by last access
..if packet comes along of cat1; cat1 should be first in structure to lookup
current packet

Server is dictator in APP. Clients may request values, but server can accept or
decline them and send different values instead.

==== CONFIG-PACKET (2)
change settings of client; payload is a dict with the corresponding key/value
pairs set (only the ones we want changed)

- device id
- seat numbers
- timeouts

Problem with synchronizing the received settings back to the client. Either not
synced or time delay every time the value is accessed (for reading)

Can use json because it hardly ever gets sent
-> no need to compress (bit count the message)

API-Network (apin)

into api -> `JOIN(seats_[seat:{}]) -> BOOL` y/n +
out of api <- `CONFIG(settings:{})` +
- server wants to change settings on this client

apin needs to manage own network settings -> e.g. own .config() method

`api-n.start()` -> start the (packet) loops +
`api-n.stop()` -> stop all loops

apin identifies the pi automatically to the server (keeps track of its id).
Above the apin level the client id is unknown. The server on the other hand has
to be made aware of the client id (or a translation between apin-ids and external
ones has to be provided)

A problem is the device id. Since the client can either provide an id
(e.g. used before) or request a new one, automatic generation requires the apin
to be aware of all existing clients

<- `apin.newDeviceID(key:"ip:port") -> 16 bit int` +
- request new unique (unused) device id for a registering client. Has to be > 1

`apin.join()` and `apin.config()` are part of the client api (not needed on server).
On the other hand `apin.newDevice()`,.. are not needed on the client side. +
-> Make two apis inheriting from a more general one?

`sci.config()` must be registered at instantion of API-Layer +
`sci.personUpdate()`: one of the people has changed +
-> update them all +
`sci.unjoin()`: leave the audience (e.g. at `stop()`) +
make it possible via `sci.config()` to stop monitoring the sensor (or maybe even
shutdown the whole client)

Person id can be arbitrary (albeit unique) string +
maintain a device -> person mapping (incoming) +
maintain a person -> device mapping (outgoing; also if client req. specific
person id -> determine if used or not) +
`ssi.personUpdate()`: update info for a person. The question is if a sensor monitors
multiple people (and sends info on all of them, even when only one has changed)
-> do multiple personUpdate() or give it a [] +
for now make it [] (can still do multiple) +
`ssi.getNeighbours(id)`: which people are on the same device as the person id
(-> might share settings) +
might need a si specific settings page +
`ssi.newPerson()`: check if present and conflicting with already registered people,
otherwise generate a new id and correct id -> return the person

Force Sensitive Resistor

_p88-Battery FSR Voltmeter sketch_

FSR seems to be very sensitive - only light touch with thumb sends it already to
full volts (1.55V). But placing a cushion on it doesn't seem to bother the sensor. +
Could not really test further as the connections were not particular stable and
kept getting undone.

Soldered two shortish cables to the contacts of the FSR. Could not attach
crocodile clips to the sensor - constantly falling off or shorting out.


== 2015-05-27
If pi pin is used to power resistor (FSR) full force would come to 3.3V and
triggers at around 1.3V. So assuming a linear activation curve, 60% of the range
the sensor is capable of, would trigger the pi pin input. Which is a bit much because +
a) it is very sensitive and +
b) we only want to have near to full pressure triggering it. +
On top of that it isn't linear, but more of log-curve. So it actually isgoing to
reach the trigger-voltage a lot sooner - more than 60% activated. +
-> A voltage divider to lower max. volts. Put it between 1.3 and 1.7/1.8/2.0?

_p94-FSR GPIO voltage divider_

Results in stem:[\thicksim 1.1V] with no touch which mostly tends to trigger the listening

enabling the built in pull down resistor in `GPIO.setup(3, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_DOWN)`
seems to fix this

`GPIO.FALLING` seems very precise - only when lifting, but `GPIO.RISING` also gets
triggered when lifting (not fast enough? a bit sticky?)
possibly use stem:[1 \mu F] capacitor?

-> easiest: software debouncing and put `GPIO.BOTH` (get rising and falling)

make `ChangeInterface._on_person_update()` accurate +
-> for `APP.SensorServer` move people inside here and only forward the actually
different people. This makes sense because the fact that unchanged people get
forwarded as well is an implementation specific peculiarity for APP and should not
influence the whole interface design. +
But the actual audience management should still take place in the CrowdController.
(Again the people in `APP.SensorServer` are a necessity out of the protocol design)

Careful when changing the state of people in the CrowdController as all plugin
share the same objects -> for every changed Person generate a new instance
(to make the whole thing thread-safe)

CrowdController gets a `.people()` property (with lock)

A websocket client plugin
[NOTE]
A regular REST/HTTP client would work as well, but since it might have to support
on_person_update -> many rapid changes - faster if not necessary to create a
connection each time, but use an existing one. If one were to use a client only
for person_new and person_leave then a REST client would be just fine -> either
detect the absence of person_update or make two plugins. Start with only
new/leave - easier; really needed and following the separation directive from
@2015-06-22

connected to a webserver with some sort of db backend. Document store? DB should
be of key/value kind? Elasticsearch? MongoDB? of JSON objects/dicts

Every dict should have a last_changed field. Should only regard to this level
(e.g. changes only when a new plugin is added to root) or include every
sub-object - is max val of all sub-objects. E.g. if a value in plugin1 has changed
-> update last_changed in "plugin": {.., "last_changed": t} -> also update
last_changed in root to same time as in plugin1. +
*Pro:* Only have to look at root to rule out changes +
*Con:* Need to let changed time bubble up the (multiple) nested objects (with no
references to parent) +
Usually a request would ask directly for specific info (e.g. root: what are your
current plugins -> build menu of available plugins; then when one plugin gets
selected to be displayed -> ask for information about that plugin) +
-> no need to use a complicated (bubbling) way of keeping track of change times. +
Simultaneously the client needs to keep track of change as well. +
Only a simple REST client between plugin system/crowd and webserver won't work,
because setting updates have to travel back into the system (except maybe through
the use of long polling could this be resolved)

require file attribute for resource? file ending? +

_p106-APPMessage inheritance_

Instead of registering every supported function of th ChangeInterface, restrict
yourself to just adding an object and try calling the corresponding functions on
it. It should inherit from CI anyway. Maybe I should remove the abstract class and
only leave the `NotImplementedError` exception the. That way an object doesn't have
to implement all functions, but rather only those it chooses to. -> more hard-wiring
in the python code .. - dependency injection?
